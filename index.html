      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Climate change is impacting human health. An obvious effect of a warmer
        environment is more frequent and severe heat waves.
      </p>

      <h2>Impact on Cardiovascular Health</h2>
      <p>
        During the European heat wave of 2003, there were an estimated 35,000
        more deaths than normal in the first two weeks of August. Many of the
        deaths resulted from cardiovascular complications among the elderly. As
        heat waves become more commonplace in the future, so will the number of
        heat strokes and the onset of other cardiovascular problems. Higher
        summertime temperatures also increase tropospheric ozone concentrations
        which in turn affects people with asthma and causes lung and heart
        damage. Increases in the levels of photochemical pollutants like ozone
        are associated with a warming world.
      </p>

      <h2>Impact on Vector-Borne Diseases</h2>
      <p>
        Habitat modification also results from climate change and alters the
        regional prevalence of certain vector-borne diseases. A warmer
        environment and the accompanying incidence of extreme weather events
        will continue to affect the strength and distribution of certain
        diseases that favor standing water. The history of humankind both past
        and present has shown us that heat waves and cold spells as well as
        floods and droughts are often accompanied by disease outbreaks.
        Respiratory infections and other diseases run rampant when people are
        forced into crowded shelters due to tropical storms or flooding. In the
        aftermath of extreme weather events, conditions tend to favor many of
        the insects, bacteria, viruses and protozoa that spread disease. Higher
        temperatures and rainfall amounts affect the life cycles of disease
        carrying insects such as mosquitoes and ticks. Changes in weather affect
        contagious diseases such as influenza and pneumonia, as well as allergic
        diseases such as asthma while higher levels of humidity increase the
        incidence and severity of fungal infections and infestations.
      </p>

      <h2>Examples of Mosquito-Borne Diseases</h2>
      <p>
        For example, while West Nile encephalitis virus is not new, it recently
        caught the attention of health officials in the United States. First
        appearing in New York during the summer of 1999, West Nile killed seven
        citizens. The symptoms of this disease range from muscle weakness and
        mental confusion to brain damage and death. For most victims, however,
        the effects are mild and include headaches, swollen glands, rash, and
        aching muscles resembling the symptoms that accompany the flu. West Nile
        encephalitis is spread by birds that have been infected by mosquitoes
        carrying the virus. The first documentation of infected birds in the
        U.S. took place in Georgia and the Carolinas. By 2001, as many as twenty
        states east of the Mississippi River had detected the diseased birds.
        While less than one percent of mosquitoes carry the virus, those that
        can live from one summer to the next as a result of warmer winters are
        the cause for the continuity of the disease from year to year.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the 1990s, dengue fever appeared in South America and has grown
        to pandemic proportions with most cases appearing in the Caribbean and
        India. This viral infection is spread by mosquitoes with symptoms that
        include severe muscle aches and pain in the bones accompanied by a rash.
        A typical case lasts for a few weeks. However, dengue hemorrhagic fever
        is a severe form of the virus that can cause internal bleeding
        eventually leading to death. Crowded urban areas are more susceptible to
        outbreaks of dengue fever. In 1993 and 1994, there were epidemics of the
        disease along the Pacific Coast of Costa Rica. Later during the
        unusually warm summer of 1995, the range of the disease carrying
        mosquitoes expanded across the mountains of Costa Rica to invade the
        rest of the country as well as other parts of Central America and South
        America. It is estimated that approximately 150,000 people were infected
        with the virus and thousands of those died due to hemorrhaging. One of
        the worst outbreaks on record occurred in 2007 throughout the Caribbean
        affecting hundreds of thousands of inhabitants and killing at least 200
        individuals. As these regions are exposed to higher rainfall totals as a
        result of climate change, more pools of stagnant water along roadside
        ditches and in open containers contribute to a rise in the number of
        mosquitoes that carry the virus.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another relatively new mosquito-borne viral fever is Chikungunya. The
        symptoms of this viral infection include a sudden high fever, severe
        headache, and a variety of skin rashes which continue for a week or
        more. This condition can be accompanied by arthritis-like pain in the
        bones and joints which persist for weeks or months. The high fever
        usually lasts a couple of days before finally breaking. Chikungunya and
        dengue fever are spread by the Aedes albopictus and the Aedes aegypti
        mosquito, both of which are predominant in the warm, moist regions of
        the southern United States. According to the Center for Disease Control,
        approximately 30 cases of Chikungunya have been reported in the U.S.
        among persons who recently traveled to parts of Asia that had
        experienced outbreaks of the fever. Chikungunya first appeared in 1952
        along the border of Tanganyika and Mozambique in east Africa, and by
        1999 it had spread to Malaysia. Thousands of cases were reported in
        southern India during the fall of 2004, and the virus has since infected
        more than one million individuals across that country along with another
        300,000 on the islands of the Indian Ocean. There is no effective means
        of curing the virus other than time, and the only preventive treatment
        is mosquito netting and pesticide. If climate change enhances the
        monsoonal rains in this region of the world, health officials fear an
        increase in outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases which could likely
        swamp local hospitals and clinics.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most widespread mosquito-borne disease is malaria. The symptoms
        consist of headache, weakness, anemia, fever, chills, and intestinal
        pain. Most victims of malaria survive, but they live with chronic pain.
        The parasite transmitted by the mosquito may lie dormant in the host and
        not become active for weeks or months. Once infected, a person may build
        immunity to the disease. However, in most cases there is the potential
        of being re-infected multiple times. Additionally, the disease can be
        transmitted by blood transfusions. There are more cases of malaria today
        than ever before in human history. The disease has been documented in
        more than 100 countries
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        There are more cases of malaria today than ever before in human history.
        The disease has been documented in more than 100 countries. In short,
        climate change and the associated warming of many regions across the
        globe will undoubtedly allow many diseases previously confined to the
        tropics to spread in their range and occurrence. Climate models and
        scenarios of varying degrees of warming predict a higher number of
        extreme weather events along with increased precipitation in the middle
        latitudes where most people live. Since many of the tropical diseases
        have insect-borne vectors, the warmer and wetter world of the future
        will undoubtedly have a pronounced impact on human health.

          <p>
            This addendum provides an insight into the stylistic choices made in
            the CSS code for the document. These choices are aimed at enhancing
            the visual appeal and readability of the content while maintaining a
            professional and academic tone.
          </p>

          <!-- Font Choices -->
          <h3>Font Choices</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                The chosen font family is "Arial, sans-serif," which ensures a
                clean and easily readable text.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The use of sans-serif fonts for body text contributes to online
                readability. While there are more decorative and unique fonts
                available, a conservative choice like Arial ensures broad
                compatibility and readability across different devices and
                platforms.
              </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                The font sizes for headings and text were carefully selected to
                create a visual hierarchy.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The main heading, <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, is set at 24px,
                making it the most prominent element on the page.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Subheadings <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> and
                <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> are smaller, at 20px and 18px,
                respectively. This stepwise reduction in size helps readers
                identify the structure of the document easily.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The main text is set at 16px with a line height of 1.6. This
                size and spacing ensure that the content is comfortable to read.
                The choice of 16px balances readability and space efficiency.

                The body background (#9bf19e) and article background (#fff)
                choices create a clean and readable content area while providing
                a visual separation from the rest of the page. This promotes
                focused reading.

            <li>
              <p>
                The article container has a white background, subtle padding

          <!-- HTML Abuse Section: Correcting Semantic Structure -->
          <h1 class="part2">HTML Abuse</h1>
          <p>
            During the styling process, I eliminated instances of HTML abuse
            where elements were chosen for their appearance rather than semantic
            meaning. This helped me maintaining a well-structured and accessible
            document. Some of the changes I made include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Correcting the heading tags (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>,
                <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, etc.) to ensure that they reflect the
                appropriate hierarchy of content. For instance, ensuring that
                the main title of the document uses an
                <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag, subheadings use
                <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, and so on, to improve the document's
                structure.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Replacing instances of line breaks (<code>&lt;br&gt;</code>)
                used for spacing and layout purposes with CSS properties such as
                margins and padding. This enhances consistency in formatting and
                separates content from design.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Removing redundant and unnecessary HTML elements that were added
                solely for styling purposes. By sticking to a more streamlined
                HTML structure, I enhance the maintainability and cleanliness of
                the code.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Correcting the use of empty or meaningless HTML elements by
                either giving them semantic meaning or replacing them with more
                appropriate elements to improve the document's accessibility.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These adjustments serve to make the HTML structure more meaningful,
            allowing assistive technologies to interpret the content correctly
            and enhancing the overall quality and longevity of the document. The
            goal for me is to create a web page that is both visually appealing
            and inclusive for all users.
