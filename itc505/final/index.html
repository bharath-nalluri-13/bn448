      <h1>LightsOut Game Addendum</h1>

      <h2>Creative Choices:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Color representations: Black represents lights are off, and the grey
          color represents the lights are on.
        </li>
        <li>Used the grid layout for organizing the game board.</li>
        <li>Followed a simple and clear design with a planned approach.</li>
        <li>
          Added number of counts showing how many time a user clicked the tiles.
        </li>
        <li>Added a winning message and made it look more attractive.</li>
        <li>Users can simply restart the game with Restart button</li>
        <li>Made sure that the game is mobile-friendly too. It works as good as the desktop site.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Challenges Faced and How I Overcame:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          At first, when user finishes the game and clicks restart, the click
          counter started from 1 instead of 0. Made sure that the game reset
          correctly after winning by reviewing and adjusting the JS code.
        </li>
        <li>
          I was able to deliver a simple alert message, but it took time to make
          the win message more appealing.
        </li>

        <li>
          DOM manipulation and event handling caused some errors. Learned to
          handle and troubleshoot challenges.
        </li>
        <li>
          I had to complete the game multiple times to test the results and the
          alert message. Took a bit of time.
        </li>
        <li>Finally once user finishes the game, an alert message pops up with congratulations message and an option to restart
        </li>
        
      </ul>

      <h2>Insights Learned During the Process:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Importance of simple and enjouyable design for the game.</li>
        <li>
          Game functions: Learnt to handle multiple functions at once for the
          game
        </li>

        <li>
          JavaScript's DOM and event driven model were main learnings for me.
        </li>
      </ul>
