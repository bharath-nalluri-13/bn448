        This page features a Holy Grail layout and an interactive Rock Paper Scissors game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        The user can make a choice, and the computer randomly selects its choice, with the result displayed on the page.
        The styling and layout have been enhanced with vibrant colors to create an engaging user experience.

        <strong>JavaScript Solution Overview:</strong> The JavaScript code generates a random computer choice, compares it with the player's choice, and determines the winner.
        The result is displayed, and a "Play Again" button allows the user to reset the game for another round.

        <br><br>

        <strong>Challenges and Solutions:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Animating the game result display:</strong> Initially, achieving smooth animations for the game result proved challenging.
                Utilizing CSS transitions for the result text and computer choice brought about a significant improvement,
                providing a visually appealing and seamless transition between game rounds.</li>
            <li><strong>Button alignment and centering:</strong> Ensuring consistent and centered button alignment, especially with the introduction of the "Play Again" button,
                required meticulous styling adjustments. Strategic use of margin and display properties was crucial to achieving the desired layout,
                resulting in neatly aligned and centered buttons within the game container.</li>
            <li><strong>User engagement:</strong> To enhance user engagement, I focused on creating a more interactive experience.
                The addition of a "Play Again" button allows users to initiate new rounds swiftly, contributing to a more enjoyable and dynamic gameplay.</li>
        </ul>

        <br><br>

        <strong>Addendum:</strong>
        <br>
        The development of this Rock Paper Scissors game was not only about coding the logic but also about refining the user interface and addressing challenges to ensure a polished product.
        The challenges faced in animation, button alignment, and user engagement were valuable learning experiences that contributed to the overall success of the project.

        Overall, this showcases the integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and visually appealing web application and it is a great learning curve for me.
